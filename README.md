# Description
After 72 hours of on and off work (most of which was done in the last few hours), we have finally finished our debut product: ECHO THROUGH THE AZTEC!

Originally we were looking at a Metroidvania style puzzle game with collectible tools. Each tool would be required for a section and they would all need to be used for the final level.

We didn't have as much time as we would'ave liked to make more levels or make more collectible items and mechanics but we're pretty proud of what we were able to do. For most of us, this was our first time participating in Ludum Dare and creating in our respective roles.

We've all learned a lot from working together to create something of our own!

We hope you find ETA as fun as we do and we appreciate any constructive feedback :)!

### Instructions
Simply download the folder and run the executable!

### Known Issues:
Sometimes the light stones will flip orientation. In that case, some puzzles can still be solved but it is recommended to restart the level by pressing 'R'. Also note that the teleport mechanic teleports the player's head to the location of the orb and will only do so if there is enough space below the orb (1 block of space).
